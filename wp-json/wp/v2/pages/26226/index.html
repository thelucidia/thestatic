Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Therefore, some of the limitations in this section and elsewhere in the Terms may not apply to a Purchaser. In particular, nothing in these terms shall affect the statutory rights of any Purchaser or exclude injury arising from any wilful misconduct or fraud of Emenaverse FZCO in Dubai or Emenaverse Ltd in BVI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Complete Agreement<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These Terms set forth the entire understanding between the Purchaser and Emenaverse FZCO in Dubai and Emenaverse Ltd in BVI with respect to the purchase and sale of $LUCID.

These attacks may result in theft or loss of Lucid Tokens, or cause the <a href=\"http:\/\/lucidia.gamezonezone.com\/\">Lucidia platform<\/a> to malfunction in other ways. The Company cannot guarantee that the Lucidia platform will be immune from any malicious attack, and security weaknesses may be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risk of Blockchain Weaknesses<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technologies are still in an early stage of development and their application is of an experimental nature which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory, and reputational risks. Despite the efforts of the Company to secure the Lucidia platform, it is possible that the Lucidia platform will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately secure, which may result in the loss of Lucid Tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risk of Uninsured Losses<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using the Lucidia platform are generally uninsured.

It may be difficult or impossible to liquidate the Lucid Tokens in the event of a downswing in the market price. This can result in a complete loss of value of the Lucid Tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risk of Regulatory Changes or Actions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Lucidia platform could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital tokens like Lucid, which could limit or prohibit the use of Lucid Tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By purchasing Lucid Tokens, you represent that you understand these and other risks associated with your purchase, ownership, and use of Lucid Tokens and that you have carefully considered the risks and the potential rewards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Severability<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Purchaser and the Company agree that if any portion of these Terms is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>No Waiver<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The failure of the Company to require or enforce strict performance by the Purchaser of any provision of these Terms or the Company\u2019s failure to exercise any right under these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company\u2019s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by the Company of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by the Company shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor be legally binding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>THE PURCHASER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE PURCHASER IS PURCHASING $LUCID AT THE PURCHASER\u2019S SOLE RISK AND THAT $LUCID IS PROVIDED ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED).

The English version shall prevail in case of differences in translation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Governing Law<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Terms, the arbitration clause contained in them, and all non-contractual obligations arising in any way whatsoever out of or in connection with these Terms are governed by, construed, and take effect in accordance with St. Vincent and the Grenadines law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Arbitration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Any dispute or difference arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the legal relationships established by these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination (\u201cDispute\u201d), shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules which will be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause, save for any waiver of any rights the parties would otherwise have to any form of appeal or recourse to a court of law or other judicial authority, which rights are expressly reserved. The number of arbitrators shall be three. The seat of the arbitration shall be London. The language of the arbitration shall be English.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Emenaverse FZCO and Emenaverse Ltd and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>ANNEX A<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>$Lucid Risks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By purchasing, owning, and using $Lucid, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Risk of Losing Access to $Lucid Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of $Lucid stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing $Lucid will result in loss of such $Lucid. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your $Lucid. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store $Lucid in, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your $Lucid. Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving $Lucid, or provides an address that is not ERC-20 compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risk of Mining Attacks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the blockchain protocol, $Lucid are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating $Lucid transactions on the blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the platform and $Lucid, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving $Lucid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the platform or $Lucid in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Emenaverse team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect the platform and $Lucid, including the utility of $Lucid for obtaining services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risks Associated with Markets for $Lucid<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to $Lucid (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risks of Uninsured Losses<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, $lucid tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Emenaverse FZCO, to offer recourse to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The regulatory status of $lucid tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Lucidia project. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the project and $lucid tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the project and $lucid tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale, and delivery of $lucid tokens constitutes unlawful activity or that $lucid tokens are a regulated instrument that requires registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale, and delivery thereof. Emenaverse FZCO may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risks Arising from Taxation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The tax characterization of $lucid tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing $lucid tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risk of Competing platforms<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open-source code and protocol underlying the project and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Lucidia services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because $lucid tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Lucidia project or Emenaverse FZCO, all decisions involving the company\u2019s products or services within the project or the company itself will be made by Emenaverse FZCO at its sole discretion. These decisions could adversely affect the project and the utility of any $lucid tokens you own, including their utility for obtaining services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unanticipated Risks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptographic tokens such as $lucid tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Annex, there are other risks associated with your purchase, possession, and use of $lucid tokens, including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Annex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Further Information<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emenaverse, like any other business, has the right to modify its terms of service and adjust its prices in accordance with changing circumstances and market conditions. By doing so, Emenaverse can ensure that it continues to offer its customers the best possible experience while also remaining financially sustainable. As such, it is important for customers to remain aware of any updates to the Emenaverse&#8217;s terms and pricing, so that they can continue to make informed decisions about their interactions with this innovative and evolving industry.
